# Expression Analysis

In this directory, you can find two `R` scripts containing the code used in
the differential expression analysis.

## `DEA_script.R`

This script contains all the steps done in the differential expression analysis
from top to bottom without any explanation nor plots.

## `DEA_plots.R`

This script contains the different codes used to perform the differential
expression analysis. The names of the variables are the same as the ones
used in the `DEA_script.R` for an easier mapping and reproducibility. Each
plot has a small explanation of the required objects and some of the used
parameters.
